  <h2>Physical Fitness</h2>
  <p>Since I was a young boy I've been interested in physical fitness. Even as young as eight years old, I had started doing pushups and situps daily. 
    I dabbled in a variety of sports, from wrestling, to Ruby to Track & Field, but eventually landed on the Highland Games as my primary sport in 
    adulthood. I was lucky to have a lot of opportunities to train with some truly exceptional athletes, and through them I learned and developed my 
    own training methodologies. I've since been the Highland Games Lightweight World Champion three times, and I am to date the only athlete in the 
    sport to have broken the world record for their class in each of the nine events. Needless to say, my experience in physical fitness has been a 
    tremendously fulfilling journey that has shaped me into the goal oriented and intrinsicly motivated individual that I am today.

  <h2>Computer Tinkering</h2>
  <p>I've alwasy enjoyed learning about computers and how they make our lives easier. As a teenager, I often found myself playing around in the Windows 
    Command Shell, exploring what could be done in a terminal. Eventually, my interests turned toward more practical applications, and I started learning 
    programming skills to make my job as a Personal Trainer and Athletic Coach semi-automated. Starting with Excel, I learned quite a bit about functions 
    and developed my first calculator in a Google Sheets document. What started as a simple calculation sheet to quickly and easily produce appropriate 
    loads for the athletes I coached eventually grew into a document containing dozens of sheets containing all the logic of my own training methodologies. 
    I had essentially built a simple software, operating on the google sheets platform that could take a few imputs and athletic performance metrics, and 
    the built in automation could produce for me an entire workout program that I had previously done one step at a time. From there I could simply tweak 
    what the sheet had output for the sake of individual differences of each athlete, and the time I spent writing workouts was dropped by nearly 90%. It 
    wasn't a difficult decision to start learning more efficient ways to develop these tools, so I started learning Python which I've sinse translated my
    Google Sheets document into. I've since returned to school to pursue a degree in Software Engineering, and I'm finding I may even enjoy this more than 
    Physical Fitness, which I never expected in a million years. 
  </p>
  <h2>Music</h2>
  <p>I have been an avid fan of music of all kinds my entire life. Through school, I played the Tenor Saxophone in a concert band, jazz band and a Sax 
    quartet that a few friends of mine put together. I'm not as proficient as I am with the Sax, but I also play the piano, guitar and to some degree 
    even the bagpipes. I haven't played as much in recent years, but I expect that I will never stop exploring new music to listen to, and truly, no genres
    are off limits. Most recently I've been thoroughly enjoying a revisiting Third Wave Ska bands like 'Reel Big Fish', 'The Mighty Mighty Bosstones', and 
    'Streetlight Manifesto'. But while I'm working out, my go to music is the kind of metal that makes your skelleton vibrate and your soul shake. I went 
    through an underground French Rap phase, a Novelty Folk Pop phase, even a classical phase. I genuinely believe that all music has something to offer 
    and enjoy, and while I certainly have preferences, I love learning more about music that I haven't yet heard.
